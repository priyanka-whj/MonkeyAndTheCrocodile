**Story**
Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a jamoon (berry) tree, which was on the banks of the river. 
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile & his wife. One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river & rested under the tree. 
The kind hearted monkey offered him some berries. The crocodile came back the next day for more berries, as he loved them. 
As days passed by, the crocodile & the monkey became good friends.
One day, monkey sent some berries for the crocodile's wife. She ate the berries & liked them, but was jealous, as she didn't like her husband spending time with monkey. She told her husband, "If the berries are so juicy, I wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would be. Get me the heart of the monkey." The crocodile was not willing to kill his friend, but had no choice.
