**Story**
Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a jamoon (berry) tree, which was on the banks of the river. 
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile & his wife. One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river & rested under the tree. 
The kind hearted monkey offered him some berries. The crocodile came back the next day for more berries, as he loved them. 
As days passed by, the crocodile & the monkey became good friends.
